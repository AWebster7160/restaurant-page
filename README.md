2/13/2024 - First project using webpack and exporting/importing ES6 modules. Content div contents will be dynamically constructed with DOM manipulation. Will use webpack-dev-server to monitor edits live, and HTML webpack plugin, with an index.html template in src. Building will push to a dist/.

2/15/2024 - Good return to more in depth and refined styling. Still lacks responsive design (will revisit when I reach advanced HTML/CSS). Plenty of practice with grid again in order to build the menu. Also simple form implementation on contact page.
